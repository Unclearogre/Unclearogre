I'm Uncle Roger.  Unfortunately, some usurper took my username before I could so I'm using a version coined by [Chris Crawford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Crawford_(game_designer)) back in the '80s.  Anyway, I've been programming since before you were born -- almost certainly [literally](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/literal).

I joined Github in order to publish a module for MagicMirror that I created by scraping broken bits off the playing field after a robotics competition and gaff-taping them to an existing module to make it do something completely different.
